# 🌐 Introducing AIR-WALL

This project aims to develop a security toolkit using the ESP32 microcontroller to detect and protect Wi-Fi networks from deauthentication and jamming attacks. It features a web-based dashboard, real-time monitoring, and automatic countermeasures.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Wi-Fi deauthentication and jamming attacks are simple to execute but disruptive. Most networks lack affordable, real-time detection tools. This project solves that by providing a compact and effective solution using ESP32.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time Deauth Detection
- Protected Management Frame (PMF) Support
- Jam Detection & Countermeasures
- Web Dashboard Control
- MAC Address Logging & Monitoring
- Sleep/Restart Mode Commands
- Optional SD Card Logging

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Microcontroller: ESP32
- Language: C++ / MicroPython
- Libraries: `WiFi.h`, `WebServer.h`, JSON
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript Dashboard
- Optional: GPS, RTC, SD Card Modules

## 🧪 Use Case
- Ethical hacking & Pen Testing
- Home and Office Wi-Fi Protection
- Educational & Research Demonstration
